                <span class="caption">An experimental close range weapon that uses hyperconcentrated heat as its projectiles.
                    After each shot, the shotgun must be opened to allow its heat-generating cores to vent excess heat, stopping them from melting or exploding. This process is largely automated, requiring little more from the user than a flick of the wrist.

                <span class="caption">A weapon created during the Final War for medium-to-long distance combat. Uses electric pulses to fire microscopic pieces of metal at incredibly high speeds.
                    Weapons that use this technology have been dubbed "electric guns", and it quickly became the new standard, replacing bullet guns. Due to still requiring a microscopic projectile, its ammo is not actually infinite, but it would take weeks of non-stop firing to run out and refilling is as easy as just scraping some flakes from scrap metal or even the gun's surface. </span>

                    As with most advanced technologies, it was originally created for use in war, as its explosive-generating system was extremely fast at digging trenches, destroying obstacles or resupplying explosive weapons. </span>

                <span class="caption">Pressing primary fire will instantly fire a piercing hitscan beam, which can pierce through an infinite amount of enemies and deal 8 damage on each hit. After firing, all Railcannons will go on cooldown, taking 16 seconds for the player to be able to fire any Railcannon again. This is indicated by a lightning bolt meter on the HUD, and the weapon will make a distinct electric noise when it is ready to fire again, even if it is not currently equipped.
